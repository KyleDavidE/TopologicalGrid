# Topological grid

The premise of this is to make a grid system where the only data stored is what edges connect to what other edges. (As well as reflection data, used at the ends of Möbius stips)
This allows the creation of Möbius stips, Torus, Klein bottles as well as more exotic layouts such as parallel hallways of differing length and infinitely branching mazes.
